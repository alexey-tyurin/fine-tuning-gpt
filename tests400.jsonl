SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.
