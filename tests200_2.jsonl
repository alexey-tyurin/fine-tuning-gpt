ANALYSIS APPROACH:\n   - Carefully analyze the entire message for explicit and implicit requests\n   - Look for action verbs and specific service mentions\n   - Consider context clues and hospitality-specific terminology\n   - Identify the most urgent or primary need if multiple are present\n   - Focus on what the user wants to accomplish, not just what they're asking about\n   - Identify the intention number and name (e.g., \"INTENTION: #16 - Request room cleaning\")\n\n3.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

SPECIAL CASES:\n   - For complex requests, break down the message to identify the core intention\n   - For vague messages, look for context clues about the user's situation\n   - For messages with multiple separate requests, identify the primary one first\n   - If a request doesn't clearly match any intention, select the closest match or #39 (Request human support)\n\nLIST OF INTENTIONS:\n1.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:\n   - Carefully analyze the entire message for explicit and implicit requests\n   - Look for action verbs and specific service mentions\n   - Consider context clues and hospitality-specific terminology\n   - Identify the most urgent or primary need if multiple are present\n   - Focus on what the user wants to accomplish, not just what they're asking about\n   - Identify the intention number and name (e.g., \"INTENTION: #16 - Request room cleaning\")\n\n3.
